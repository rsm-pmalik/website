    "text": "3 Experimental Results\n\n3.1 Charitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\ntodo: make a barplot with two bars. Each bar is the proportion of people who donated. One bar for treatment and one bar for control.\ntodo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made (you can do this as a bivariate linear regression if you want). It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A. Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or something that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control.\nNOTE: Linear regression results appear replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper. Probit results do not, despite Table 3 indicating its results come from probit regressions…\n\n\n3.2 Differences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\ntodo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable ratio1 then regress gave on ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 (or alternatively, regress gave on the categorical variable ratio). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision.\ntodo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios. Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?\n\n\n3.3 Size of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?\ntodo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients – what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?\ntodo: Make two plots: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot."

    "text": "4 Simulation Experiment\nAs a reminder of how the t-statistic “works,” in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nSuppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made.\nFurther suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.\n\n4.1 Law of Large Numbers\nto do: Simulate 10,000 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You’ll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you’ll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. This average will likely be “noisey” when only averaging a few numbers, but should “settle down” and approximate the treatment effect (0.004 = 0.022 - 0.018) as the sample size gets large. Explain the chart to the reader.\n\n\n4.2 Central Limit Theorem\nto do: Make 4 histograms at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. The repeat for the other 3 histograms. Explain this sequence of histograms and its relationship to the central limit theorem to the reader."

This might indicate that there are\nstrong multicollinearity problems or that the design matrix is singular.\n\nResponse Rates:\n1:1 = 0.0207\n2:1 = 0.0226\n3:1 = 0.0227\n\nDifferences (from raw data):\n2:1 − 1:1 = 0.0019\n3:1 − 2:1 = 0.0001\n\n\n&gt; I analyzed whether higher match ratios increased the probability of donating among individuals in the treatment group. According to the raw data:\n&gt;\n&gt; - The response rate for the **1:1 match** was approximately `X.XXX`.\n&gt; - The response rate for the **2:1 match** was `X.XXX`.\n&gt; - The response rate for the **3:1 match** was `X.XXX`.\n&gt;\n&gt; The differences in response rates between 1:1 and 2:1 (`Δ = Y.YYY`) and between 2:1 and 3:1 (`Δ = Z.ZZZ`) were both **very small**.\n&gt;\n&gt; Two-sample t-tests for each pair of match ratios yielded **p-values above 0.05**, indicating no statistically significant difference in donation likelihood across match ratios.\n&gt;\n&gt; I also ran a regression with `C(ratio)` as a categorical variable. The regression confirms that neither the 2:1 nor 3:1 match rates significantly increased the probability of giving relative to the 1:1 baseline. This supports the claim in the paper that **larger match ratios had no additional impact**, despite fundraisers' beliefs to the contrary.\n&gt;\n&gt; These findings replicate the authors' results in **Table 2A** and the narrative on **page 8**, showing that while offering *a* match increases giving, increasing the match **size** beyond 1:1 does not further motivate donors.\n\n\n2.2 Size of Charitable Contribution\n\n\nT-test (unconditional): t = 1.8605, p = 0.0628\n                            OLS Regression Results                            \n==============================================================================\nDep.

Selection into giving makes this analysis descriptive rather than causal."

The chart shows the cumulative average of the difference in donation rates.\n&gt;\n&gt; As expected, the line fluctuates at first due to sampling noise but begins to settle near 0.004 as the number of simulations increases. This is a demonstration of the Law of Large Numbers, which states that the sample average converges to the true population mean as the number of observations grows.\n\n\n3.2 Central Limit Theorem\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling Distributions at Varying Sample Sizes (CLT)\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Each histogram shows the distribution of **1,000 average treatment effects** computed from repeated samples of size 50, 200, 500, and 1000. As the sample size increases:\n&gt;\n&gt; - The center of the distribution remains near **0.004**, the true effect\n&gt; - The **spread (standard deviation)** of the estimates shrinks\n&gt; - The shape becomes increasingly **bell-shaped and normal**\n&gt;\n&gt; This is the **Central Limit Theorem** in action: the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution, even though the underlying data (Bernoulli draws) are not normally distributed."
