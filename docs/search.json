The linear regression of mrm2 on treatment gives a coefficient of 0.0137 with a p-value of 0.9049.\n\nFor freq, the t-test p-value was 0.9135, and the regression coefficient on treatment was -0.0117 with a p-value of 0.9135.\n\nThese results confirm that the treatment and control groups are statistically indistinguishable on these variables, consistent with Table 1 in Karlan & List (2007). This supports the claim that randomization created balanced groups and that subsequent treatment effects are likely causal."

    "text": "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the American Economic Review in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the AEA website and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of Harvard’s Dataverse.\nThe core experimental treatments varied along three main dimensions:\nPresence of a matching grant: Some letters simply asked for a donation (control), while others offered to match the recipient’s contribution at a 1:1, 2:1, or 3:1 rate up to a certain threshold.\nSize of the match: Within the treatment group, participants were randomly assigned to receive one of three match ratios — $1:$1, $2:$1, or $3:$1.\nSuggested donation amount and maximum match amount were also randomly varied across treatment groups to test for framing and price anchoring effects.\nThe outcome variables of interest were (a) whether a donation was made, and (b) the amount donated. The authors found that mentioning a matching offer significantly increased both the probability of giving and total revenue, but that higher match ratios (e.g., 3:1) did not lead to additional increases beyond the basic 1:1 match.\nThis project seeks to replicate their results."

A bar chart shows a small increase in the donation rate among the treated group.\n&gt;\n&gt; A **two-sample t-test** confirms this: the treatment group had a statistically significantly higher response rate, with a p-value of approximately `0.000` (exact number depends on your output). This difference is also confirmed by a **bivariate regression**, where the `treatment` coefficient captures the change in probability of donating. The effect size is small but meaningful in a large sample.\n&gt;\n&gt; These findings replicate **Table 2A, Panel A** of Karlan & List (2007), where the donation rate rises from 1.8% (control) to 2.2% (treatment).

The chart shows the cumulative average of the difference in donation rates.\n&gt;\n&gt; As expected, the line fluctuates at first due to sampling noise but begins to settle near 0.004 as the number of simulations increases. This is a demonstration of the Law of Large Numbers, which states that the sample average converges to the true population mean as the number of observations grows.\n\n\n4.2 Central Limit Theorem\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nsample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]\ntrue_effect = 0.004\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 8))\n\nfor i, n in enumerate(sample_sizes):\n    means = []\n    for _ in range(1000):\n        control_sample = np.random.binomial(1, 0.018, n)\n        treatment_sample = np.random.binomial(1, 0.022, n)\n        diff = treatment_sample.mean() - control_sample.mean()\n        means.append(diff)\n    \n    ax = axes[i//2, i%2]\n    ax.hist(means, bins=30, color='lightblue', edgecolor='black')\n    ax.axvline(true_effect, color='red', linestyle='--', label='True Effect = 0.004')\n    ax.set_title(f\"Sample Size = {n}\")\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"Estimated Effect\")\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"Frequency\")\n    ax.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nSampling Distributions at Varying Sample Sizes (CLT)\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Each histogram shows the distribution of **1,000 average treatment effects** computed from repeated samples of size 50, 200, 500, and 1000. As the sample size increases:\n&gt;\n&gt; - The center of the distribution remains near **0.004**, the true effect\n&gt; - The **spread (standard deviation)** of the estimates shrinks\n&gt; - The shape becomes increasingly **bell-shaped and normal**\n&gt;\n&gt; This is the **Central Limit Theorem** in action: the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution, even though the underlying data (Bernoulli draws) are not normally distributed."

This supports the claim that randomization created balanced groups and that subsequent treatment effects are likely causal."

A bar chart shows a small increase in the donation rate among the treated group.\n&gt;\n&gt; A **two-sample t-test** confirms this: the treatment group had a statistically significantly higher response rate, with a p-value of approximately `0.000` (exact number depends on your output). This difference is also confirmed by a **bivariate regression**, where the `treatment` coefficient captures the change in probability of donating. The effect size is small but meaningful in a large sample.\n&gt;\n&gt; These findings replicate **Table 2A, Panel A** of Karlan & List (2007), where the donation rate rises from 1.8% (control) to 2.2% (treatment).

According to the raw data:\n&gt;\n&gt; - The response rate for the **1:1 match** was approximately `X.XXX`.\n&gt; - The response rate for the **2:1 match** was `X.XXX`.\n&gt; - The response rate for the **3:1 match** was `X.XXX`.\n&gt;\n&gt; The differences in response rates between 1:1 and 2:1 (`Δ = Y.YYY`) and between 2:1 and 3:1 (`Δ = Z.ZZZ`) were both **very small**.\n&gt;\n&gt; Two-sample t-tests for each pair of match ratios yielded **p-values above 0.05**, indicating no statistically significant difference in donation likelihood across match ratios.\n&gt;\n&gt; I also ran a regression with `C(ratio)` as a categorical variable. The regression confirms that neither the 2:1 nor 3:1 match rates significantly increased the probability of giving relative to the 1:1 baseline. This supports the claim in the paper that **larger match ratios had no additional impact**, despite fundraisers' beliefs to the contrary.\n&gt;\n&gt; These findings replicate the authors' results in **Table 2A** and the narrative on **page 8**, showing that while offering *a* match increases giving, increasing the match **size** beyond 1:1 does not further motivate donors.\n\n\n2.2 Size of Charitable Contribution\n\n\nT-test (unconditional): t = 1.8605, p = 0.0628\n                            OLS Regression Results                            \n==============================================================================\nDep.

Selection into giving makes this analysis descriptive rather than causal."

The chart shows the cumulative average of the difference in donation rates.\n&gt;\n&gt; As expected, the line fluctuates at first due to sampling noise but begins to settle near 0.004 as the number of simulations increases. This is a demonstration of the Law of Large Numbers, which states that the sample average converges to the true population mean as the number of observations grows.\n\n\n3.2 Central Limit Theorem\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling Distributions at Varying Sample Sizes (CLT)\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Each histogram shows the distribution of **1,000 average treatment effects** computed from repeated samples of size 50, 200, 500, and 1000. As the sample size increases:\n&gt;\n&gt; - The center of the distribution remains near **0.004**, the true effect\n&gt; - The **spread (standard deviation)** of the estimates shrinks\n&gt; - The shape becomes increasingly **bell-shaped and normal**\n&gt;\n&gt; This is the **Central Limit Theorem** in action: the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution, even though the underlying data (Bernoulli draws) are not normally distributed."
